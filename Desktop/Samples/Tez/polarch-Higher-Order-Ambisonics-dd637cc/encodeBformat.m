function WXYZ = encodeBformat(signals, src_directions)
%ENCODE_BFORMAT Encode a number of sound sources in ideal B-format.
% ENCODE_BFORMAT encodes a number of signals coming from certain directions,
% to ideal B-format signals. The traditional sqrt(2) factor is assumed to
% be on the dipoles.
%
% Inputs:   
%   signals:    matrix of [L x K] signal value;, where L is the length of
%               the signals and K is the number of them.
%   src_dirs:   source directions in [azi1 elev1; azi2 elev2;... ; aziK elevK]
%               convention, in degrees
%
% Outputs:
%   WXYZ:       [L x 4] B-format signals
