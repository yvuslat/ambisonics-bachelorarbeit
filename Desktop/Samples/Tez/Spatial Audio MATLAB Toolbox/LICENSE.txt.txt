This spatial audio Matlab toolbox was created by Dimitar Kostadinov, under the supervision of Dr. Joshua D. Reiss.
Comments and improvements to the toolbox should be addressed to josh.reiss@elec.qmul.ac.uk

Users are encouraged to modify and use the toolbox however they see fit, as long as acknowledgment is given to the original authors. 
It is hoped that the community will use this as the starting point for standardising core spatial audio programming 
methods, and as a tool to assist new researchers in the field.
